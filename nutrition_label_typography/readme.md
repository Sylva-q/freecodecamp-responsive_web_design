learning summary

1. new semantic tag learned (span): to group or style small portions of text or elements. Combined with CSS to apply styles or behaviors. example: 
'<p><span><span class="bold">Total Fat</span> 8g</span> <span class="bold">10%</span></p>'
/In this p element, 'total fat 8g' was grouped de separated from '10%', so that '10%' can be styled to bold. And in inside 'total fat 8g', 'total fat' was nested as another group again aso that it can be bold./
2. Combination use of flexbox and span for layout, example:
p {
  margin: 0;
/* The flex property enables flexible layouts by distributing space among items in a container, allowing alignment and spacing adjustments. */
  justify-content: space-between;
/* spreads children horizontally, pushes the first child (<span><span class="bold">Total Fat</span> 8g</span>) to the far left and the last child (<span class="bold">10%</span>) to the far right.
Result:*/

4. box-sizing: border-box; ensures that the padding and border are included within the elementâ€™s total width and height.
This makes sizing more predictable and prevents elements from overflowing their containers when you add padding or borders.
