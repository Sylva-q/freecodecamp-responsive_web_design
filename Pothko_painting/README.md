Every HTML element is its own box – with its own spacing and a border. This is called the Box Model.  Use CSS and the Box Model to create Rothko-style rectangular art pieces.
Key Concepts Learned:

✅ Box Model structure: content, padding, border, and margin.

✅ How different box model properties affect layout and spacing.

✅ Practical usage of height, width, margin, and padding to simulate abstract artwork.

✅ Use of display: block elements and stacking them vertically.

Takeaways:
Understanding the CSS box model is crucial for controlling layout and spacing in web design. This hands-on project visualized those abstract concepts by turning them into colorful, layered rectangles—just like Rothko's paintings.
