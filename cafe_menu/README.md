# Cafe-menu
Learn basic CSS by designing a menu page for a cafe webpage.

CSS tells the browser how to display your webpage. CSS can be used to set the color, font, size, and other aspects of HTML elements.

What I learned summary:
- The display of a webpage is decided by combined effect of html and css file.
- The content and tructure of the webpage should be nicely organized in html, and define class name for each element.
- Styling in css can be done by both element and class selector

1. HTML Structure
How to build the basic HTML5 skeleton using:
- <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, and <body>
- Semantic elements like <header>, <main>, <section>, and <footer>
- Headings (<h1>, <h2>), paragraphs (<p>), and images (<img>)

*2. Linking External CSS
Use the <link> tag to attach an external stylesheet (styles.css) to your HTML page.

3. CSS Fundamentals
- Text formatting: text-align, font-size, font-style, color
- Backgrounds: background-color, background-image
- Spacing: margin, padding, width, max-width
- Borders: border-style, border-color, border-radius
- Selectors:
    - Element selectors (e.g. p, h1)
    - Class selectors (e.g. .flavor, .price)
    - Grouped selectors (e.g. h1, h2)
- Display types: block, inline, inline-block
- CSS Comments: Using /* comment */ syntax

*4. Layout and Design
- Structuring a simple two-column layout using:
    - Containers (like .item)
    - Left-aligned and right-aligned elements (.flavor and .price)
- Styling the menu box with max-width, centered layout, and background color

*5. Interactive Styles (Pseudo-classes)
Learn basic pseudo-classes like (:hover) for links and buttons

6. Adding Images and Links
- Insert decorative images using <img>
- Add clickable external links with <a href="...">
